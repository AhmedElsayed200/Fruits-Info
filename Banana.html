<h1>11 Evidence-Based Health Benefits of Bananas<h1>

<h2><a id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
	<p>
		Bananas are extremely healthy and delicious.
		They contain several essential nutrients and provide benefits for digestion, heart health and 
		weight loss. Aside from being very nutritious, they are also a highly convenient snack food.
		Here are 11 science-based health benefits of bananas.

<h2><a id="nutrients">Bananas Contain Many Important Nutrients</a></h2>
	<p>
		Bananas are among the world’s most popular fruits.
		Native to Southeast Asia, they are now grown in many warm parts of the world.
		Bananas vary in color, size and shape.
		The most common type is the Cavendish, which is a type of dessert banana. Green when unripe, 
		it yellows as it matures.
		Bananas contain a fair amount of fiber, as well as several antioxidants. One medium-sized 
		banana (118 grams) also boasts:
		<ul>
			<li>Potassium: 9% of the RDI</li>
			<li>Vitamin B6: 33% of the RDI</li>
			<li>Vitamin C: 11% of the RDI</li>
			<li>Magnesium: 8% of the RDI</li>
			<li>Copper: 10% of the RDI</li>
			<li>Manganese: 14% of the RDI</li>
			<li>Net carbs: 24 grams</li>
			<li>Fiber: 3.1 grams</li>
			<li>Protein: 1.3 grams</li>
			<li>Fat: 0.4 grams</li>
		</ul>
		Each banana has only about 105 calories and consists almost exclusively of water and carbs. 
		Bananas hold very little protein and almost no fat.
		The carbs in green, unripe bananas consist mostly of starch and resistant starch, but as the 
		banana ripens, the starch turns into sugar (glucose, fructose and sucrose).
	</p>

<h2><a id="blood">Bananas Contain Nutrients That Moderate Blood Sugar Levels</a></h2>
	<p>
		Bananas are rich in pectin, a type of fiber that gives the flesh its spongy structural form.
		Unripe bananas contain resistant starch, which acts like soluble fiber and escapes digestion.
		Both pectin and resistant starch may moderate blood sugar levels after meals and reduce appetite by 
		slowing the emptying of your stomach.
		Furthermore, bananas also rank low to medium on the glycemic index (GI), 
		which is a measure — from 0–100 — of how quickly foods increase blood sugar levels.
		The GI value of unripe bananas is about 30, while ripe bananas rank at about 60. The average value of 
		all bananas is 51. This means that bananas should not cause major spikes in blood sugar levels in healthy individuals.
		However, this may not apply to people with type 2 diabetes, who should probably avoid eating a lot of 
		well-ripened bananas — and monitor their blood sugar carefully if they do.
	</p>
	
<h2><a id="health">Bananas May Improve Digestive Health</a></h2>
	<p>
		Dietary fiber has been linked to many health benefits, including improved digestion.
		A medium-sized banana has about 3 grams of fiber, making bananas a fairly good fiber source.
		Bananas contain two main types of fiber:
		<ul>
			<li>Pectin: Decreases as the banana ripens.</li>
			<li>Resistant starch: Found in unripe bananas.</li>
		</ul>
		Resistant starch escapes digestion and ends up in your large intestine, where it becomes food 
		for the beneficial bacteria in your gut.
		Additionally, some test-tube studies propose that pectin may help protect against colon cancer.
	</p>

<h2><a id="weight">Bananas May Aid Weight Loss</a></h2>
	<p>
		No study has directly tested the effects of bananas on weight loss. However, bananas do have 
		several attributes that should make them a weight-loss-friendly-food.
		For starters, bananas have relatively few calories. An average banana has just over 100 
		calories — yet it is also very nutritious and filling.
		Eating more fiber from vegetables and fruits like bananas has repeatedly been linked to lower
		body weight and weight loss.
		Furthermore, unripe bananas are packed with resistant starch, so they tend to be very filling 
		and may reduce your appetite.
	</p>

<h2><a id="heart">Bananas May Support Heart Health</a></h2>
	<p>
		Potassium is a mineral that is essential for heart health — especially blood pressure control.
		Despite its importance, few people get enough potassium in their diet.
		Bananas are a great dietary source of potassium. One medium-sized banana (118 grams) contains 
		9% of the RDI.
		A potassium-rich diet can help lower blood pressure, and people who eat plenty of potassium have 
		up to a 27% lower risk of heart disease.
		Furthermore, bananas contain a decent amount of magnesium, which is also important for heart health.
	</p>

<h2><a id="powerful">Bananas Contain Powerful Antioxidants</a></h2>
	<p>
		Fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of dietary antioxidants, and bananas are no exception.
		They contain several types of potent antioxidants, including dopamine and catechins.
		These antioxidants are linked to many health benefits, such as a reduced risk of heart disease and
		degenerative illnesses.
		However, it is a common misunderstanding that the dopamine from bananas acts as a feel-good chemical
		in your brain.
		In reality, dopamine from bananas does not cross the blood-brain barrier. It simply acts as a strong 
		antioxidant instead of altering hormones or mood.
	</p>

<h2><a id="full">Bananas May Help You Feel More Full</a></h2>
	<p>
		Resistant starch is a type of indigestible carb — found in unripe bananas and other foods — which 
		functions like soluble fiber in your body.
		As a rule of thumb, you can estimate that the greener the banana, the higher its resistant starch content.
		On the other hand, yellow, ripe bananas contain lower amounts of resistant starch and total fiber — but 
		proportionally higher amounts of soluble fiber.
		Both pectin and resistant starch offer appetite-reducing effects and increase the feeling of fullness after meals.
	</p>

<h2><a id="sensitivity">Unripe Bananas May Improve Insulin Sensitivity</a></h2>
	<p>
		Insulin resistance is a major risk factor for many of the world's most serious diseases, including type 2 diabetes.
		Several studies reveal that 15–30 grams of resistant starch per day may improve insulin sensitivity by 33–50% in as 
		few as four weeks.
		Unripe bananas are a great source of resistant starch. Therefore, they may help improve insulin sensitivity.
		However, the reason for these effects is not well understood, and not all studies agree on the matter.
		More studies should be conducted on bananas and insulin sensitivity.
	</p>

<h2><a id="kidney">Bananas May Improve Kidney Health</a></h2>
	<p>
		Potassium is essential for blood pressure control and healthy kidney function.
		As a good dietary source of potassium, bananas may be especially beneficial for maintaining healthy kidneys.
		One 13-year study in women determined that those who ate bananas 2–3 times per week were 33% less likely to 
		develop kidney disease.
		Other studies note that those who eat bananas 4–6 times a week are almost 50% less likely to develop kidney 
		disease than those who don't eat this fruit.
	</p>
	
<h2><a id="exercise">Bananas May Have Benefits for Exercise</a></h2>
	<p>
		Bananas are often referred to as the perfect food for athletes largely due to their mineral content and easily digested carbs.
		Eating bananas may help reduce exercise-related muscle cramps and soreness, which affect up to 95% of the general population.
		The reason for the cramps is largely unknown, but a popular theory blames a mixture of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
		However, research gives mixed findings about bananas and muscle cramps. While some studies find them helpful, others find no effects.
		That said, bananas do provide excellent nutrition before, during and after endurance exercise.	
	</p>
	
<h2><a id="diet">Bananas Are Easy to Add to Your Diet</a></h2>
	<p>
		Not only are bananas incredibly healthy — they're also one of the most convenient snack foods around.
		Bananas make a great addition to yogurt, cereal and smoothies. You can even use them instead of sugar 
		in your baking and cooking.
		Furthermore, bananas rarely contain any pesticides or pollutants due to their thick protective peel.
		Bananas are incredibly easy to eat and transport. They are usually well-tolerated and easily digested — they
		simply have to be peeled and eaten.
		It doesn't get much easier than that.
	</p>

<h2><a id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
	<p>
		Bananas are a popular fruit that happens to provide numerous health benefits.
		Among other things, they may boost digestive and heart health due to their fiber and antioxidant content.
		They may even aid weight loss, as they're relatively low-calorie and nutrient-dense.
		Ripe bananas are a great way to satisfy your sweet tooth. What’s more, both yellow and green bananas can 
		keep you healthy and feeling full.
