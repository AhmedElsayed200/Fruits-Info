<h1>HEALTHY FOODS</h1>

<h2>Fast-foods delicious but killers!</h2>

	<p> 
		Now a days, there are a bunch of varity among foods thanks to the new restaurants (MAC, KFC, Pizza hut, ...etc.)
		as they are the source of the new foods we see in our daily life now days. Those new foods, which are called 
		fast-foods, are the source of many many diseases that will destroy us by the time. 
		Although those fast-foods are very delicious, they are the killers! 
		Here is a list of dangerous diseases that are caused by fast food:
		Disease #1: Heart Disease
		The more fast food you eat, the more chances of obesity and this in turn, can increase the risk of heart disease 
		as one tends to have lower levels of good cholesterol and higher levels of bad cholesterol.
		Disease #2: Liver Damage
		Since the distribution of the fast food meal that you eat doesn’t get distributed in the body evenly, the fat 
		tends to accumulate in the liver and can cause permanent damage, inflammation and even scarring.
		Disease #3: Stroke
		Since obesity causes blockages in the arteries, this can separately result in high “bad” cholesterol levels 
		leading to high blood pressure levels as well. Due to these blockages, the blood that travels to the brain is 
		blocked (as the arteries carry them) and this results in a stroke.
		Disease #4: Diabetes (Type 2)
		This is again an obesity-related disease which occurs when your pancreas is unable to supply a sufficient amount 
		of insulin to convert sugars to energy. This unconverted sugar floats around in the blood and can raise the risk 
		of one getting Type 2 Diabetes.

<h2>A study shows the impacts of Fast-foods on your healt</h2>

	<p>
		Unhealthy eating habits have contributed to the obesity epidemic in the United States: about one-third of U.S. adults 
		(33.8%) are obese and approximately 17% (or 12.5 million) of children and adolescents aged 2—19 years are obese.1 Even 
		for people at a healthy weight, a poor diet is associated with major health risks that can cause illness and even death. 
		These include heart disease, hypertension (high blood pressure), type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and certain types of cancer. 
		By making smart food choices, you can help protect yourself from these health problems. 
		The risk factors for adult chronic diseases, like hypertension and type 2 diabetes, are increasingly seen in younger ages, 
		often a result of unhealthy eating habits and increased weight gain. Dietary habits established in childhood often carry 
		into adulthood, so teaching children how to eat healthy at a young age will help them stay healthy throughout their life.

<h2>Why healthy foods</h2>

	<p>
		You now know what will happen to you if you eat those fast-foods, so you should stop eating them and search for an 
		alternative source of food that will make you healthy.
		The link between good nutrition and healthy weight, reduced chronic disease risk, and overall health is too important to 
		ignore. By taking steps to eat healthy, you'll be on your way to getting the nutrients your body needs to stay healthy, 
		active, and strong. As with physical activity, making small changes in your diet can go a long way, and it's easier than you think!
		Fruits and vegetables are very important for our health. They maintaine our breathing making it stable, beside saving our
		body and make us fit. In addition, they help us doing better while working as they regulate the flow of sugar and maintaine
		the blood pressure.
