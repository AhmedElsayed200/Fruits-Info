<h1>Cucumbers: Health Benefits & Nutrition Facts</h1>

<h2><a id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
	<p>
		Few foods are as cool as a cucumber. These low-calorie veggies contain many nutritional benefits, including 
		hydrating properties and valuable nutrients.
		There are hundreds of varieties of cucumber, and they come in dozens of colors, but the edible types are 
		classified as being for either slicing or pickling, according to Cornell University's Growing Guide. Slicing 
		cucumbers are cultivated to be eaten fresh, while pickling cucumbers are intended for the brine jar. Slicing 
		cucumbers are usually larger and thicker-skinned than pickling ones.
		In the United States, commonly planted varieties of slicing cucumber include Dasher, Conquistador, Slicemaster, 
		Victory, Comet, Burpee Hybrid and Sprint, according to the World's Healthiest Foods website. Commonly planted 
		varieties of pickling cucumber include Royal, Calypso, Pioneer, Bounty, Regal, Duke and Blitz.
		While most people think of cucumbers as vegetables, they are actually a fruit. They contain seeds and grow from 
		the ovaries of flowering plants. Cucumbers are members of the plant family Cucurbitaceae, which also includes 
		squashes and melons. The most common type of slicing cucumber found in a grocery store is the garden cucumber, 
		Cucumis sativus, according to World's Healthiest Foods.

<h2><a id="profile">Nutritional profile</a></h2>
	<p>
		Cucumbers are good sources of phytonutrients (plant chemicals that have protective or disease preventive properties)
		such flavonoids, lignans and triterpenes, which have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer benefits, 
		according to World's Healthiest Foods. 
		"We should definitely seek out foods that are nutrient-rich, using the positive approach of what to put on your plate
		vs. what to keep off," said Angela Lemond, a Plano, Texas-based registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for 
		the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The peel and seeds are the most nutrient-dense parts of the cucumber. They contain
		fiber and beta-carotene. "Beta carotene is an antioxidant that helps with immunity, skin, eye and the prevention of cancer," 
		said Lemond. A study published in the Pakistan Journal of Nutrition found that cucumber seeds were a good source of minerals, 
		and contained calcium.
		"Cucumbers are naturally low in calories, carbohydrates, sodium, fat and cholesterol," said Megan Ware, a registered dietitian 
		nutritionist in Orlando, Florida. There are just 16 calories in a cup of cucumber with its peel (15 without). You will get about
		4 percent of your daily potassium, 3 percent of your daily fiber and 4 percent of your daily vitamin C. They also "provide small
		amounts of vitamin K, vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, manganese and vitamin A," Ware said.
		Here are the nutrition facts for cucumbers, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates food labeling 
		through the Nutritional Labeling and Education Act:

<h2><a id="health">Health benefits of cucumbers</a></h2>
	<p>
	<h4>Hydration</h4>
		Cucumbers are 95 percent water, according to Ware. This makes cucumbers a great way to stay hydrated, especially during 
		the summer. A cup of cucumber slices is "nearly as thirst-quenching as a glass of water," according to Eating Well magazine. 
		"They say we can get 20-30 percent of our fluid needs through our diet alone, and foods like these certainly help," added
		Lemond. "Not only are they high in water content, they also contain important nutrients that play a part in hydration like
		magnesium and potassium." 
		The anti-inflammatory compounds in cucumbers help remove waste from the body and reduce skin irritation, according to the 
		Cleveland Clinic. Preliminary research also suggests cucumbers promote anti-wrinkling and anti-aging activity, according to
		an article in the journal Filoterapia.
	<h4>Cancer prevention</h4>
		Cucumbers contain two phytonutrient compounds associated with anti-cancer benefits: lignans and cucurbitacins. In recent years,
		pharmaceutical companies have been paying special attention to cucurbitacins, hoping to use them in new cancer drugs. According 
		to a 2010 research review published in Scientific World Journal, scientists have found that cucurbitacins can help block the 
		signaling pathways that are important for cancer cell proliferation and survival. 
		Cucurbitacins can also inhibits the growth of pancreatic cancer cells, according to a 2009 study published in the Journal of 
		Cancer Research looked at cucurbitacin B (which cucumber contains) on human pancreatic cancer cells and found that cucurbitacin
		supplements inhibited the growth of seven pancreatic cancer cell lines by 50 percent, and also increased apoptosis, or "death by 
		suicide," of pancreatic cancer cells. 
		According to World's Healthiest Foods, lignans may protect against cancer through working with the bacteria in the digestive tract.
		The bacteria take the lignans and convert them into compounds such as enterodiol and enterolactone, which can bind onto estrogen 
		receptors and possibly reduce the risk of estrogen-related cancers, such as ovarian, breast, endometrial and prostate cancers. The 
		research is not yet clear on whether lignans actually assert anti-cancer benefits. 
		A 2009 meta-analysis published in the British Journal of Cancer found little or no association between lignan intake and reduced breast
		cancer risk. Similarly, most studies have not found significant correlations between lignan intake and reduced prostate cancer risk, 
		according to the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University, though one study of older Scottish men published in the British 
		Journal of Nutrition showed that consuming an enterolactone-containing serum reduced the risk of prostate cancer. 
		On the other hand, a Journal of Nutrition study of nearly 800 American women found that those with those with the highest lignan intake
		had the lowest risk of ovarian cancer. Furthermore, a study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute looked at nearly 
		1,000 women in the San Francisco area and found that postmenopausal women with the highest lignan intakes had the lowest risk of endometrial
		cancer.

<h2><a id="heart">Heart health</a></h2>
	<p>
		"Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables of all kinds is associated with a reduced risk for many health conditions, such as heart 
		disease, diabetes, stroke and obesity," said Ware. Cucumbers' potassium content may be especially helpful in this regard. One cup of
		sliced cukes contains only about 4 percent of the body's daily potassium needs, but it comes with significantly fewer calories than 
		most high-potassium foods like bananas. Potassium is an essential part of heart health, according to the American Heart Association. 
		A study of 12,000 adults, published in Archives of Internal Medicine, showed that those who consumed 4,069 mg of potassium each day 
		lowered their risk of cardiovascular disease and ischemic heart disease by 37 percent and 49 percent, respectively, compared to those 
		who took 1,793 mg per day. 
		Several studies have linked cucumber consumption to reducing hypertension. Many studies have linked it with lower blood pressure because
		it promotes vasodiliation (widening of the blood vessels), according to Todayâ€™s Dietitian. A 2017 study published in Public Health of 
		Indonesia found that elderly participants with hypertension saw a significant decrease in blood pressure after consuming cucumber juice 
		for 12 days. Additionally, a 2009 review in Indian Academy of Clinical Medicine suggested that hypertension sufferers incorporate cucumbers
		into their diets because of the fruit's low sodium content. 
		The vitamin K in cucumbers is also known to be essential in the blood-clotting process, according to the Harvard School of Public Health.

<h2><a id="weight">Weight loss</a></h2>
	<p>
		Cucumbers are a low-calorie food therefore a popular ingredient in diet meals. A 2011 study in the journal Obesity found that greater 
		water consumption correlated with more weight loss in middle-age and older adults. Participants who consumed 1 pint (500 milliliters)
		of water prior to eating a meal lost an average of 4 lbs. (2 kilograms) more than participants who did not. Snacking on water-dense foods 
		like cucumbers can be an effective way to up water intake. 
		But Lemond cautions against relying too much on water-dense foods like cucumber. "We know that people that eat higher quantities of fruits 
		and vegetables typically have healthier body weights. However, I do not recommend eating only cucumber.  You will lose weight, but that 
		weight will be mostly muscle," she said. 
	</p>
	
<h2><a id="brain">Brain health and memory</a></h2>
	<p>
		Recently, scientists have taken interest in the flavonoid fisetin. Cucumbers are a good source of fisetin, which studies have 
		associated with protecting nerve cells, improving memory and decreasing the risk of Alzheimer's in mice, according to a 2013 
		review in the journal of Antioxidants & Redox Signaling. The same review found promising results for the relationship between
		fisetin and cancer prevention.
